# Structures

FFMT uses a small set of standard MATLAB structures to keep data and metadata consistent across the workflow.
These containers define *how information is stored and passed* between modules (loading, processing, QC/editing, and modeling).

Use this section as a quick reference to understand:
- what each structure represents,
- when it is created/used,
- and how it relates to the others.
